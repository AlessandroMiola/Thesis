\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chpr:acknowledgement}
First of all, I would like to thank my thesis supervisors: Prof. Ferdinando Ametrano for having shared his passion for the subject and knowledge with me and Prof. Daniele Marazzina for his precious advices during the drawing up phase.\\ \ \\
Then, I would like to express my profound gratitude to my parents and Albi for having always been by my side: mum, for for having taught to me that gentle manners always win, for her sensibility and for being mum (it is difficult to say it otherwise!); dad, for having wisely taught to me that anything can be reached with commitment and determination and for all the efforts spent in helping me become a better man; Albi for having turned bad days with a smile or a joke. And a big thank goes to my grandparents too, for having always supported me despite the distance.\\ \ \\
Furthermore, I would like to thank my high school friends. Having encountered all of you has been a great gift. In particular, Gio (the nicest man I know), the great Lollo and the wise Luca. And again Ambra, Anna, Chiara, Cicchi, Genna, Marti, Massi, Miks and Ventu.\\ \ \\
Finally, a special thanks also goes to the great friends met at university. First of all to Dodo, Gallo, Gigi, Giulio, Gugo, Michi, Simo and Teo. These years would have been even harder without you. And again to Antea, Pietro, Richi and many others I had the opportunity to meet and work with.\\ \ \\
Thank you all.
