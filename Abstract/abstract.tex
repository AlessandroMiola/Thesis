Insufficient privacy is recognized to be one of the major vulnerabilities of the Bitcoin's protocol, even because it undermines its fungibility. Bitcoin eliminates the need for a trusted third party, but mainly faces users' privacy by hiding them behind pseudonymous addresses.\\
This work aims at presenting \textit{confidential transactions}, the first proposal for a transaction format with encrypted amounts in Bitcoin, which would strongly increase value privacy. It exploits homomorphic encryption which does not remarkably hurt universal validation of transactions, a crucial premise for the achievement of a distributed consensus on the order of valid transactions.
